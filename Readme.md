SFMovies machine learning project
=======================================

The aim of this project is to teach myself spark and machine learning using mllib. The data I'm working with is taken from here
[Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)
 
### The aim of the project
Given a director, can the model predict the director's favorite movie location in San Francisco.
 
### Getting started
It is assumed that you have a local standalone version of `Apache Spark 2.0+` running locally.

To run the project, first run the `getData.sh` file, which will download the dataset to root of this project
You can look at the Main Object under `org.gp.sfmovies` package for further details. Currently this project is still under WIP
